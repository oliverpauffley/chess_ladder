A python program to create and manage a chess ladder for a school chess club

The program creates a list of students and adjusts their ranks as they play games. If a student wins against a higher ranked student they move by half the gap in ranks.
All other moves are 1. Statistics about the games are also recorded. Lots to implement but is currently a working prototype.
